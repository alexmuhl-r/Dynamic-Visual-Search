# Dynamic Visual Search
Dynamic visual search tasks in Python and SR Research's Experiment Builder by Alex Muhl-Richardson and Hayward Godwin

Please note: all of these tasks require SR Research's Experiment Builder and an Eyelink eye tracker to run (tested on Eyelink 1000 and 1000 Plus). However, there is no reason in principle why the core elements of these tasks that exist as Python code could not be adapted to other software and hardware configurations.

### Branches

The branches of this respository include different specific task configurations that have been used in our experiments:

- **[exp1/2-control](https://github.com/alexmuhl-r/dynamic-visual-search/tree/exp1/2-control)** was used in the control conditions in Experiments 1 and 2 in our JEP: Applied paper (see below)

- **[exp1-random](https://github.com/alexmuhl-r/dynamic-visual-search/tree/exp1-random)** was used in the random condition of Experiment 1 in our JEP: Applied paper

- **[exp2-random-sequence](https://github.com/alexmuhl-r/dynamic-visual-search/tree/exp2-random-sequence)** was used in the random sequence of Experiment 2 in our JEP: Applied paper

- **[exp3-low-prevalence](https://github.com/alexmuhl-r/dynamic-visual-search/tree/exp3-low-prevalence)** was used in Experiment 3 in our JEP: Applied paper

- **[colour-digit-dual-task](https://github.com/alexmuhl-r/dynamic-visual-search/tree/colour-digit-dual-task)** was used in our Applied Cognitive Psychology paper

- **[high-prevalence](https://github.com/alexmuhl-r/dynamic-visual-search/tree/high-prevalence)** was used in our preprint on PsyArXiv
